<h2>MINE PUMPING IN AGRICOLA&#8217;S TIME AND LATER</h2>

<div class="title"><p><i>Coins are a source of information much used by historians. Elaborately
detailed mining landscapes on 16th-century German coins in the National
Museum, discovered by the curator of numismatics and brought to the
author&#8217;s attention, led to this study of early mine-pumping devices.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Author</span>: <i>Robert P. Multhauf is curator of Science and Technology,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The habit</span> of heavy reliance on a single source for the substance of the
history of Medieval and Renaissance mining techniques in Europe has led
to a rather drastic over-simplification of that history, a condition
which persists tenaciously in the recent accounts of Parsons, Wolf, and
Bromehead.<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> Our preoccupation with Agricola, who has been well known
to the English-language public since the Hoovers&#8217; translation of 1912,
seems to have inhibited the investigation of the development of the
machines he describes so elegantly. More seriously, the opinion that
mining techniques remained essentially the same for a century or two
beyond his time appears to have hardened into a conviction.<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small></p>

<p>The history of the technology of mining, as distinguished from
metallurgy, is largely a history of mechanization, and that
mechanization has until the last century consisted principally in the
development of what Agricola calls <i>tractoriae</i>&mdash;hauling machines. That
hauling machines of some complexity, Archimedian screws and a kind of
noria, were used by the Romans for dewatering mines has been known for
some time. Evidence of the survival of this technology beyond the fall
of Rome remains to be found, and it is generally agreed that mining
activity declined through the first millenium. The revival and extension
of mining in the central European areas of German settlement is thought
to have occurred from the 10th century, with an intensive development of
the region known to Agricola (Erzgebirge) in the 13th century.<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small></p>

<p>This revival appears to have paralleled in general the political and
cultural revival, but, as in any mining region, the exhaustion of easily
workable surface deposits marked a critical point, when the necessity of
deeper mining led to the construction of supported tunnels and the
introduction of machinery for removing ores and water from deep mines.
On the basis of revisions of capital structure and mining law which he
regards as inspired by the financial necessities of deep mining, Bechtel
dates this development from the mid-14th century.<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small> The mid-14th
century situation is confused by the occurrence of the Black Death,
which reduced mining activity drastically, and the events of which
Bechtel speaks have been put as much as a century later.<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small> In any case,
the development of deep-mining methods had clearly made considerable
progress in nonferrous mines when the <i>De re metallica</i> was written, in 1556.</p>

<p>These large silver coins weighing up to 15 ounces were first issued in
1574 in Brunswick by Duke Julius (1568-1589) of the Wolfenbuttel line.
Their historical background is rather unusual and interesting.</p>

<p>In 1570 the Duke decided to increase the output of his silver mines in
the Harz and arranged for the opening of three new mines. In order to
insure the retention of a portion of this increased silver output under
his control, the Duke decided to issue an entirely new kind of silver
coin which he called &#8220;Loeser,&#8221; meaning redeemer. These were larger than
taler-size pieces, and were struck in denominations from 1&#188; to 16
talers. The Duke ordered that each of his subjects was to purchase one
of these large coins, the size of the coin to be acquired depending on
the individual&#8217;s wealth. The owners were not allowed to use these pieces
in everyday trade, but could pawn them in case of dire need. They were
expected to produce them at any time upon demand. Thus a means of
hoarding, a &#8220;treasure piece,&#8221; was created, and the risk of draining the
country&#8217;s wealth through replacement of good, full-weight silver coins
with imported base currency was to some extent limited. At the same
time, the Duke had a considerable sum of money at his disposal in case
of emergency.</p>

<p>Similar Loesers were issued up to 1688 by different rulers of Brunswick.
Some of the later issues are commemorative in character and might have
served for presentation purposes. The workmanship of the majority is
exquisite. They portray personages real and ideal and ornate coats of
arms, in addition to the elaborate mining landscapes shown here. The
U. S. National Museum is fortunate in having a number of examples through
the generosity of Mr. Paul A. Straub.</p>

<p>For calling my attention to these coins, and for other invaluable
assistance, I am indebted to the former curator of the numismatic
collections of the U. S. National Museum, the late Stuart Mosher, and to
the present curator, Dr. V. Clain-Stefanelli.</p>

<p><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows an overshot waterwheel driving through Stangenkunsten
pumps in three separate shafts, each covered by the typical conical
shaft house. It is possible that these shaft houses also cover horse
whims used to operate bucket hoists such as that shown in the lower
center. A house with three chimneys in the background may be the
smelter. The horse over whose head the Deity holds a wreath is a symbol
of Luneberg.</p></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the mechanical equipment of this era we
are largely indebted to Agricola. He classifies hauling machines into
four types; the ordinary bucket windlass, the piston (suction) pump, the
chain of dippers, and the rag and chain pump. Although the first three
had been known in antiquity, and the last perhaps a century before his
time,<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small> their<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 116]</span>
use in mining would appear to date from the mid-14th
century or later. His is not an historical account, and one who attempts
to compare it with others of contemporary or later times encounters a
difficulty in his use of descriptive Latin names rather than the common
German names used by most others. English and German editors have
interpreted them as follows:<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small></p>

<p><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows two shaft-houses covering pumps driven by
Stangenkunsten. The source of power, hidden by the curious &#8220;log cabin&#8221;
at the right, was probably a waterwheel. I have not found evidence that
the Stangenkunst was used to operate bucket hoists, as appears to be the
case here. It will be noticed that the above and below ground portions
of these illustrations do not correlate precisely. This coin, like the
others, shows miners doing various things familiar from
Agricola&mdash;divining, digging, carrying, and operating windlasses.</p>

<p><a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> exhibits the principal advantage of the Stangenkunst, in its
utilization to connect a waterwheel located in a valley stream to driven
machinery on the mountain some distance above. The lute-playing girl
(Lautenspielerin) refers to the Lautental mine. A Stangenkunst (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>)
existed here as recently as 1930.</p>

is an aqueduct, one function of which is to supply a waterwheel in the
house below, which in turn delivers power through the Stangenkunst to
two open shafts. The reverse (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>), an unusually fine view of the
inner workings of a mine, shows, above ground, a typical horse whim
driving a bucket windlass. Below ground is shown a crank-driven piston
pump typical of those driven by Stangenkunst. In this case, however, it
is driven by an underground vertical treadmill.</p></div></div>

<p>The resemblance of the German term for bag (Bulge) to the Latin term for
bucket (bulga) instead of the Latin term for bag (canalis), and the
presence of buckets (K&uuml;beln), bags (Bulgen), pockets (Taschen), or cans
(Kannen) as components of three of Agricola&#8217;s four categories of hauling
machines are reasons enough for the apparent superfluity of German
names, if not for his decision to avoid the use of German names. But it
should also be noted that the names sometimes refer to a pump and its
prime mover considered as a single machine. Such is the case with the
Kehrrad, a bucket windlass driven by a reversible waterwheel which
Agricola describes as his largest hauling machine.<small><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></small></p>

<p>Agricola describes 23 hauling devices of these four types, the
diversity resulting generally from the application of three types of
prime movers, men, horses, and waterwheels, and in the endowment of each
in turn with a mechanical advantage in the form of gearing.<small><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></small> Although
he does not specify clearly the relative importance of the various
pumps, the majority (13) use man as the prime mover. He speaks of the
advantages of some, noting that the horse whim has a power two and a
half times that of the man windlass, and emphasizing the even greater
power available in flowing water &#8220;when a running stream can be diverted
to a mine.&#8221; The most powerful machine then in use for deep mines appears
to have been the horse-powered rag and chain pump.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the important mining machines of this early period of
deep mining, according to the leading authority. But did they continue,
as has been claimed, to be the only important machines of the subsequent
century? G. E. Lohneyss,<small><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></small> writing a little over a half century after
the publication of <i>De re metallica</i>, declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The old miners [alten Bergleute] had Heintzen, Kerratt,
Bulgenkunst, Taschen-kunst, Pumpen, with which one lifted water
with cans on pulleys or with a treadmill; and they devised and
constructed these in which the poor people moved like cattle and
wore themselves out. At that time they had powerful machines
(Kunst) using swift water, although it cost much to erect and
maintain them, and was very dangerous since an iron chain of a
Bulgenkunst alone often weighed 200 centner [over 10 tons] and
more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 118]</span>But today&#8217;s artisan [jetzigen K&uuml;nstler] far surpasses the old ...
since we have in the present time invented many other mining
machines; such as the <i>Stangenkunst mit dem krummen Zapffen</i>, which
raises water at small cost over 100 Lachter [562 feet].</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="fig6" id="fig6"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i018.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Figure 6.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stangenkunst, Showing Driving Wheel,
Feldkunst, and Kunstkreuz.</span> From H. Calv&ouml;r (see footnote 15).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Stangenkunst, which can be roughly translated as &#8220;rod work with
crank,&#8221; was a piston pump driven through a crank and rods by a prime
mover located at a distant point. Agricola describes a crank-driven
piston pump, calling it a new machine invented ten years earlier.<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small>
But it is not driven bya distant prime mover. Like his other
water-powered hauling machines it can only be used &#8220;when a running
stream can be diverted to a mine.&#8221; So far as we can determine from
internal evidence, Agricola did not know the Stangenkunst.</p>

<p>Although the full development of the Stangenkunst came later, it was
apparently introduced in Agricola&#8217;s time. Its introduction to the
Erzgebirge has been put as early as 1550.<small><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></small> According to another
authority it was introduced to the Harz in 1565 by one Heinrich
Eschenbach of Meissen.<small><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></small> Its significance is only made clear to us by
later authorities. As shown in <a href="#fig3">figure 3</a> it was adapted to the
utilization of a distant stream, through the Feldstangen, an extended
horizontal series of reciprocating rods, and the Kunstkreuz (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>), a
lever in the shape of a cross for changing at right angles the direction
of power transmission. These improvements may have been almost
contemporaneous with Agricola, as Calv&ouml;r<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 119]</span> mentions the use of the
Feldkunst, which term signified the extended rods, as having been known
in 1565.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of moving the weight of a long extension of rods was
obviated, during the 17th century, through the use of a double set of
balanced rods, resembling a pantograph. At some later date the horse
whim was fitted with a crank and adapted to the Stangenkunst,<small><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1" href="#f16">[16]</a></small> thus
permitting the establishment of a veritable power network, as suggested
in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>.</p>

<p>The Freiberg mine director Martin Planer reported in 1570 the
installation since 1557 of thirty-eight &#8220;Kunsten und Zeugen&#8221; in mines
under his charge. That these were water-powered machines is clear from
his remark that their cost was only 10 to 20 percent that of &#8220;Pferden
und Knechten.&#8221;<small><a name="f17.1" id="f17.1" href="#f17">[17]</a></small> It is likely that many if not most were
Stangenkunsten, for mining treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries
testify to the continuous extension of this mechanism.<small><a name="f18.1" id="f18.1" href="#f18">[18]</a></small></p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking evidence of its importance is its
representation on the illustrated coinage of the 17th century. These
multiple talers (figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a>, <a href="#fig2">2</a>, <a href="#fig3">3</a>), happy products of the ingenious fiscal
policies of the Dukes of Brunswick, picture mining activity in the 17th
century no less elegantly than do the woodcuts of <i>De re metallica</i> a
century earlier. The Stangenkunst received its most spectacular
application in France, in its application to the driving of the second-
and third-stage pumps in the famous waterworks at Marly (1681-88), but
its real importance is better illustrated in central Europe, by the
many descriptions and drawings showing its use in the mines, driving
machinery as distant as a mile<small><a name="f19.1" id="f19.1" href="#f19">[19]</a></small> from the source of power.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 7.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Feldgestange (Stangenkunst) Near Lautental.</span>
From C. Matschoss, <i>Technische Kulturdenkmal</i>, Munich, 1932.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, that Lohneyss&#8217; &#8220;old miners&#8221; were those described by
Agricola, and that the mine-hauling machinery used in central European
mines changed in the century after him far more than has been
recognized.<small><a name="f20.1" id="f20.1" href="#f20">[20]</a></small> This thesis may further cast some light on other
technological questions. The<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 120]</span> connection between the urgency of the
problem of mine drainage in England, and the invention of the steam
engine, has often been suggested.<small><a name="f21.1" id="f21.1" href="#f21">[21]</a></small> Perhaps the &#8220;backwardness&#8221; of
Germany in steam-engine experimentation, and later in the introduction
of the Newcomen engine, was to some extent due to the adequacy of
existing machinery to meet the problem of mine flooding, for it is not
clear that this problem existed on the continent.<small><a name="f22.1" id="f22.1" href="#f22">[22]</a></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A comparison of the techniques described by Agricola with those of a
century later suggests that this was a century of significant progress
in that earlier industrial revolution described by Mumford as his
&#8220;Eotechnic phase,&#8221; characterized by &#8220;the diminished use of human beings
as prime movers, and the separation of the production of energy from its
application and immediate control.&#8221;<small><a name="f23.1" id="f23.1" href="#f23">[23]</a></small></p>

calls Sch&ouml;pfkolbenkette, appears in the Mariano Codex latinus 197, B.
180, dated 1438, in the Munich Hofbibliothek.</p>

<p><a name="f7" id="f7" href="#f7.1">[7]</a> Based on a comparison of the following editions of Agricola, <i>De re
metallica</i>: Froben, Basel, 1556 (in Latin; the first edition); <i>The
Mining Magazine</i>, London, 1912 (English translation by H. C. and L. H.
Hoover); VDI, Berlin, 1928 (German translation by Carl Schiffner).</p>

<p><a name="f8" id="f8" href="#f8.1">[8]</a> The emergence of the term Kunst in German mining terminology is
connected with the application of water power, especially to pumping
(see Heinrich Veith, <i>Deutsches Berg-w&ouml;rterbuch</i>, Breslau, 1870, article
&#8220;Kunst&#8221;).</p>

<p><a name="f9" id="f9" href="#f9.1">[9]</a> According to Veith (<i>op. cit.</i>, footnote 8, p. 306), B. R&ouml;ssler, in
his <i>Speculum metallurgiae politissimum</i> (Dresden, 1700, p. 41) says
that the Taschenkunst (pocket-work) was used with a pipe, like the rag
and chain pump, and the translator of the German (1928) edition of <i>De
re metallica</i> also uses Heinzen and Taschen interchangeably. Calv&ouml;r and
others, however, seem to use Taschenkunst for the ordinary chain of
dippers, which seems better suited to its literal meaning.</p>

<p><a name="f10" id="f10" href="#f10.1">[10]</a> Agricola, <i>op. cit.</i> (footnote 7), ed. Hoover, p. 199. His
contemporary and fellow-townsman Mathesius equates the Kehrrad to the
Bulgenkunst (<i>Sarepta</i>, p. 145, Nurnberg, 1571). According to Veith
(<i>op. cit.</i>, footnote 8, p. 286), Sebastian M&uuml;nster in his
<i>Cosmographei ...</i> (p. 381, Basel, 1558), had previously mentioned its
use in the mines of Meissen; and its introduction has been put as early
as 1500 by Otto Vogel (&#8220;Christopher Pohlem und seine Beziehungen zum
Harzer Bergb&auml;u,&#8221; <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Geschichte der Technik und Industrie</i>,
1913, vol. 5, p. 324.)</p>

<p><a name="f13" id="f13" href="#f13.1">[13]</a> Agricola, <i>op. cit.</i> (footnote 7), ed. Hoover, pp. 184-185. The
crank was centuries old at this time, and had been applied to pumping
earlier than the time mentioned by Agricola, although perhaps not in
mining. A drawing dated 1405 shows an Archimedian screw turned by a
crank (Feldhaus, <i>op. cit.</i>, footnote 6, p. 834). The <i>Mittelalterliche
Hausbuch</i> (ed. H. T. Bossert and W. F. Storck, Leipzig, 1912, Tafel 32),
a German description of technology that appeared in 1480, shows an
arrangement very like that described by Agricola, although not in mining
service.</p>

one of the chief topics of the previously cited work of Calv&ouml;r (footnote

shown by Agricola until the end of the 17th century. In 1694, however,
the famous Swedish engineer Christopher Polhem built at Falun a
water-powered conveyer system which brought the ore from the point of
origin in the mine to the smelter in a single operation, terminating
with the automatic unloading of the buckets (Vogel, <i>op. cit.</i>, footnote
10, p. 306).</p>

<p><a name="f22" id="f22" href="#f22.1">[22]</a> In 1673 Edward Browne visited Hungary and the Erzgebirge. His
report on the trip, <i>A brief account of some travels in diverse parts of
Europe</i> (2nd ed., London, 1685, p. 170), says little about machinery,
but does not mention flooding as a serious problem. Of an 84-fathom mine
called Auff der Halsbrucker, near Freiberg, he says &#8220;they are not so
much troubled with water, and have very good engines to draw water out.&#8221;
Yet the chain of dippers and rag and chain pump were evidently fallen
into disuse, as they do not appear among the mining machines reported by
Fritsche and Wagenbreth as having been described by Lohneyss (1617) or
R&ouml;ssler (1700); and Fritsche and Wagenbreth declare that German
hydraulic machinery was able to compete with the steam engine in mine
dewatering for some time into the 19th century (<i>op. cit.</i>, footnote 14,
pp. 111, 112).</p>
